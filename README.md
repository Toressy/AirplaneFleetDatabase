# AirplaneFleetDatabase

This project is a relational database system built using Microsoft Access as part of a university coursework for the 5CC507 Databases module. The system models an airplane fleet scenario, including relevant entities and relationships to manage aircraft, passengers, and flights.

## 📁 Contents

- `Airplane.accdb`: The main database file (Microsoft Access)
- `script/auto-generated script.sql`: Auto-generated SQL script from Access
- `script/my script.sql`: Custom SQL script developed for the project
- `Airplane diagram.png`: ER diagram or design visualization
- `5CC507 Databases - CW2_Project Scenario 2023.docx`: Project brief and scenario description
- `5CC507-100661485.zip`: Additional materials or final submission archive

## 🧩 Features

- Normalized relational schema
- Entity-relationship diagram for airplane operations
- SQL scripts for table creation and data manipulation
- Queries, forms, and reports (in the `.accdb` file)
- Designed in line with scenario requirements

## 🛠 Requirements

- Microsoft Access 2016 or later
- SQL viewer/editor (optional for script review)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `Airplane.accdb` in Microsoft Access.
2. Review the database schema, forms, queries, and reports.
3. SQL scripts can be found in the `/script` directory for review or re-implementation in another DBMS.

## 🎓 Educational Context

This database system was developed for the 5CC507 module at Coventry University as part of the CW2 assignment on data modeling and implementation.
